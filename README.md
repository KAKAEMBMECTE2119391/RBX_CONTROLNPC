# This script lets you control npcs in roblox but you need to understand that:
  1. It can't control REAL players.
  2. It can only control NPCs that are unanchored or with players NetworkOnwerShips.
  3. Functions avaliability depends on your EXECUTOR.
  4. Other players can break NPCs control functions.
